Research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remain of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files.
In this assignment, you will design the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data. 


Includes: 
* Output sql script of query code 
* JPGs of query output
* Table Schemata code
* ERD of CSVs  

Assignment:
